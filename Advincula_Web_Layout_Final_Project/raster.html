        For the raster final project, my initial idea was to photoshop myself with a muscular male model. I thought it would be funny, but when I began the project, I realized that I don’t take many pictures of myself in the first place. So I decided to use a photo of myself where I was posing as if I were in the movie, “This is the End.” All I had to do was search for a photo of “the rapture” in the movie and add myself in it. I wish I added more details to the beam, though.
