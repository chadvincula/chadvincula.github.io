        With my vector project in mind, I wanted to create a scene that looks like it’s from a video game. I’ve always wanted to make animations with stick figures, so when I figured out how to implement an idle animation for my stick figure, I was very excited. Animating the text of my stick figure frame-by-frame, however, was very frustrating. It’s not hard; just tedious. If I were to update this project, I’d probably animate my creature frame-by-frame as well instead of using tweens.
