        The creature that I made was from a sketch I made in 8th grade. It was meant for a creature design contest for a Facebook game, but a different artist won the contest. I must say, however, that as I look back at the sketch, my concept for this creature is very unoriginal. If you look up “Adventure Quest Djinni,” you can see the blatant similarities (but mine doesn’t look as good). I’d say the toughest part of this project was wrapping the chain links around the creature’s arms.
